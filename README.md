## How It Works
1. User writes a journal entry in the text box.
2. Each sentence is classified using a transformer-based sentiment model.
3. The app displays:
   - Individual sentence sentiment (POSITIVE / NEGATIVE)
   - Overall average sentiment score
4. The entry is saved to a local SQLite database.
5. Users can later:
   - Filter entries by date (calendar)
   - Filter by sentiment (Positive / Negative / All)
